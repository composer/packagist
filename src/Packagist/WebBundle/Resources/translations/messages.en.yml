        <p>Please make sure you have read the package <a href="%path_about%#naming-your-package">naming conventions</a> before submitting your package. The authoritative name of your package will be taken from the composer.json file inside the master branch or trunk of your repository, and it can not be changed after that.</p>
        <p><strong>Do not submit forks of existing packages.</strong> If you need to test changes to a package that you forked to patch, use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#vcs">VCS Repositories</a> instead. If however it is a real long-term fork you intend on maintaining feel free to submit it.</p>
        <p>If you need help or if you have any questions please get in touch with the Composer <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-community.md">community</a>.</p>

abandon:
    submit: Abandon Package
    warning: |
        <p>You are about to mark this package as abandoned. This will alert users that this package will no longer be maintained.</p>
        <p>If you are handing this project over to a new maintainer or know of a package that replaces it, please use
            the field below to point users to the new package. In case you cannot point them to a new package, this one
            will be tagged as abandoned and a replacement can be added later.</p>
