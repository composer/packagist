            <p>Packagist.org and Composer serve millions of PHP developers worldwide, handling billions of package installs every year. Keeping this critical infrastructure running, secure, and continuously improved requires sustainable funding.</p>
            <h3>How We Fund Open Source</h3>
            <p>We have built a sustainable model: Revenue from <a href="https://packagist.com">Private Packagist</a> subscriptions directly fund the development and operations of Packagist.org and Composer. This approach allows us to maintain our independence and focus our energy on building great tools rather than constant fundraising.</p>
            <p>Private Packagist offers businesses private package hosting, enhanced security and compliance features, mirroring of other third party repositories, and advanced dependency management tools. When you subscribe, you're not just getting powerful features for your team, you are directly supporting the open source ecosystem you depend on.</p>
